# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
Feeling pretty good about it so far!
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I did this in the wrong order, so we covered it in class prior to me seeing the material, so the challenges felt incredibly easy. In the class session we definitely had productive struggle and I picked up a few things from my group about techniques that can be used to get to the answer.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I just need to keep doing it and trying different combinations of calls and methods!
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
No questions at this time, I feel good about the resources I have to get the necessary answers.
